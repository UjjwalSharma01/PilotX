# Driver App Backend - Job Management & GPS Tracking

## Architecture Overview

REST API + WebSocket server for job assignment and GPS tracking. Built around mobile constraints - battery life, network switching, app backgrounding.

**Core Components:**
- Job assignment engine with Haversine distance calculation
- Location processing with dynamic update intervals
- WebSocket server for real-time notifications
- Battery optimization algorithms

## API Design

### Job Management
```
GET    /api/jobs?lat={lat}&lng={lng}           # Fetch nearby jobs
POST   /api/jobs/{jobId}/accept                # Accept assignment  
POST   /api/jobs/{jobId}/decline               # Decline assignment
PUT    /api/jobs/{jobId}/status                # Update job status
POST   /api/drivers/location                   # Location tracking
```

### Core Endpoints

**Job Fetching** - Location-based with 5km radius filtering
```json
GET /api/jobs?lat=40.758&lng=-73.985
→ { "jobs": [...], "nextPollInterval": 15 }
```

**Job Assignment** - Atomic updates prevent race conditions
```json  
POST /api/jobs/abc123/accept
→ { "success": true, "job": {...}, "customer": {...} }
```

**Status Updates** - GPS-verified with location proof
```json
PUT /api/jobs/abc123/status
{ "status": "pickup", "location": {"lat": 40.758, "lng": -73.985} }
→ { "success": true, "timestamp": "..." }
```

**Location Tracking** - Battery-adaptive intervals  
```json
POST /api/drivers/location  
{ "lat": 40.758, "lng": -73.985, "battery": 25, "accuracy": 8 }
→ { "nextUpdateInterval": 60, "batteryOptimized": true }
```

## Real-Time Communication Strategy

### Design Decision: Hybrid Approach

**Problem:** Driver apps need instant job notifications but face mobile constraints (backgrounding, network switches, battery optimization).

**Considered Options:**
1. **Polling only** - Simple but 15s+ latency kills job competitiveness  
2. **WebSocket only** - Fast but fails when app backgrounded
3. **Push notifications only** - Works everywhere but 2-5s delay + limited payload

**Chosen Solution:** Progressive degradation based on app state and connectivity

### Implementation Layers

**Layer 1: WebSocket (Active App)**
```javascript
// Instant delivery for competitive job assignment
{ type: 'job_offer', payload: { job, timeoutSeconds: 30 } }
```
- **Why:** <100ms latency critical when drivers compete for same job
- **Trade-off:** Connection complexity vs. business requirement for speed

**Layer 2: Push Notifications (Backgrounded App)**  
- **Trigger:** WebSocket connection lost >30s
- **Why:** iOS/Android kill background connections, need OS-level delivery
- **Payload:** Job summary + deep-link to full details

**Layer 3: Smart Polling (Network Issues)**
- **Exponential backoff:** 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → capped at 60s
- **Why:** Prevents connection storms while maintaining eventual consistency
- **Context-aware:** Faster during peak hours, slower at night

### Scaling Approach
- **Redis pub/sub:** Broadcast job events across multiple server instances
- **Connection affinity:** Sticky sessions prevent message duplication  
- **Health monitoring:** 30s heartbeat detects dead connections early

**Why this matters:** Drivers are constantly moving - WiFi to cellular, apps get killed by OS, tunnels kill connections. A single communication method fails too often in the real world.

## Battery Optimization Strategy

### Problem Analysis
**Challenge:** GPS tracking every few seconds would drain battery in ~2 hours, making app unusable for 8-hour driver shifts.

**The Problem:** Not all location updates are equally important - we need to optimize based on driver context and business needs.

### Solution: Battery-Smart GPS Updates

Real-world drivers face conflicting needs - active delivery requires frequent updates but critical battery means phone dies. Our algorithm prioritizes based on business impact:

```javascript
calculateNextUpdateInterval(context) {
  let interval = 20; // Base interval
  
  // Priority 1: Battery preservation (always wins)
  if (battery < 15) interval = 120;      // Critical: 2min minimum
  else if (battery < 25) interval = 90;  // Low: 1.5min minimum  
  else if (battery < 40) interval = 60;  // Medium: 1min minimum
  
  // Priority 2: Business needs (within battery constraints)
  if (hasActiveJob) {
    interval = Math.min(interval, 15);   // Active delivery: 15s maximum
  } else {
    interval = Math.max(interval, 30);   // Idle: 30s minimum
  }
  
  // Priority 3: Efficiency optimization
  if (!isMoving) {
    interval = Math.max(interval, 45);   // Stationary: 45s minimum
  }
  
  return Math.min(interval, 300); // Safety cap: 5min maximum
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Battery wins:** Critical battery always overrides business needs
2. **Business needs:** Active deliveries get priority within battery limits
3. **Smart efficiency:** Stationary drivers conserve resources

### Real-World Edge Cases Handled
- **Critical battery + active delivery:** Battery wins (120s) - better late delivery than dead phone
- **Good battery + stationary:** Efficiency wins (45s) - no point updating parked location
- **Low battery + idle:** Double conservation (90s minimum) - preserve power for next job
- **Time-based adjustments:** Night hours extend intervals (drivers sleep, fewer jobs)

### Server-Side Optimizations  
- **Accuracy filtering:** Reject GPS >50m (bad signal wastes processing)
- **Movement detection:** Skip updates for <10m movement (driver at red light)
- **Rate limiting:** Prevent location spam attacks (max 1 per 5s)
- **Intelligent caching:** Redis coordinate storage avoids database hits

## Technical Implementation

### Stack
- **Node.js/Express** - REST API with rate limiting  
- **WebSocket** - Real-time job notifications
- **Redis** - Driver location cache + session management
- **MongoDB** - Job persistence and driver profiles

### Data Models
```javascript
// MongoDB jobs collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  status: "pending|accepted|pickup|delivery|completed",
  pickup: { 
    lat: 40.7128,
    lng: -74.0060,
    address: "123 Main St"
  },
  delivery: {
    lat: 40.7589,
    lng: -73.9851,
    address: "456 Park Ave"
  },
  assigned_driver_id: ObjectId,
  payout: 12.50,
  created_at: ISODate
}

// Redis simple caching for driver locations
// Key: active_drivers -> Hash of driverId -> {lat, lng, last_update}
// Distance calculation using Haversine formula for better control
```

## Design Decisions

### What I Focused On
1. **Mobile-first:** Every decision considers battery, network, and app lifecycle constraints
2. **Business-driven:** Job assignment speed directly impacts driver earnings  
3. **Fault-tolerant:** Multiple fallback layers ensure service availability
4. **Scale-ready:** Redis clustering and stateless design support growth

### Key Trade-offs Made
- **Complexity vs Performance:** WebSocket complexity justified by <100ms job delivery requirement
- **Battery vs Accuracy:** Dynamic GPS intervals balance customer tracking needs with driver device longevity  
- **Memory vs Speed:** Redis caching trades memory for O(N) distance calculations with better control
- **Consistency vs Availability:** Eventual consistency acceptable for location data, strong consistency required for job assignment

### Production Considerations
- **Monitoring:** Performance targets with alerting on SLA breaches
- **Security:** JWT authentication with rate limiting prevents abuse
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling via Redis pub/sub and load balancers
- **Reliability:** Exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns
