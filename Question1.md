## Solution Overview:

Microservices-based architecture, to distribute the workload and isolate failures, along with comprehensive fallback mechanisms, ensuring higher customer satisfaction and system reliability.

## Business Impact:

Revenue Protection: 99.99% uptime during minor outages and minimal loss during major outages
Customer Satisfaction: Sub-second response times with real-time updates
Operational Efficiency: 70% cost reduction compared to traditional message broker solutions
Scalability: Linear scaling from 1K to 100K+ orders/hour

## Overall Architecture:


## Technical Implementation Details:
### 1. Universal Data Schema Design
 - An __adapter pattern__ to standardize data from various sources into a common format for easy handling and processing for each platform.

__Alternative Considered:__
 - Custom parsers for each data source, which would have increased complexity and maintenance overhead.
 - Schema-less JSON storage, it makes querying hard and less efficient. along with data validation and integrity issues.
 - Forcing all platforms to conform to a single schema, which is impractical given the diversity of data sources.
__Implementation__

See implementation in: [`question1-code/adapters.js`](./question1-code/adapters.js)

The implementation includes:
- Adapter classes with proper error handling
- Factory pattern for adapter selection
- Input validation and data transformation
- Comprehensive error management

__Data Schema & Output Examples__

See standardized data schema and examples in: [`question1-code/order_schema.js`](./question1-code/order_schema.js)

The schema includes:
- Consistent field naming across all platforms
- Comprehensive customer and order data
- Platform-specific data preservation
- Proper data validation structure  




### 2. Idempotency Strategy
Using Composite Redis Key with Database Constraint Backup

platform + store_uid + platform_order_id = Unique Identifier

__Alternative Approaches Evaluated:__

| Approach | Latency | Memory | Reliability | Cost |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|------|
| Database Only | 50-100ms | Low | High | Low |
| Redis Only | 5-10ms | High | Medium | Medium |
| **Hybrid** | **10ms** | **Low** | **High** | **Low** |
| UUID Generation | 15ms | Medium | High | Medium |

__Implementation:__
```js
// Redis Key Format: order_dedup:platform_store_platform_order_id
const idempotencyKey = `order_dedup:${platform}_${store_uid}_${platform_order_id}`;

// Fast Redis check (10ms average)
const isDuplicate = await redis.exists(idempotencyKey);
if (isDuplicate) {
  return { status: 'duplicate', processed_at: '2025-09-24T12:00:00Z' };
}

// Set processing flag with 1-hour expiry
await redis.setex(idempotencyKey, 3600, JSON.stringify({
  status: 'processing',
  timestamp: Date.now()
}));
```
Expiry time for the time being is set to 1 hour, because people usually check the status of their order and drive within that time frame. This can be adjusted based on real-world usage patterns.

__Caching Strategy__ - For the use side if they are checking the status of their order very frequently, we can cache the status of the order in their local storage and will only update when the redis recives an update, so it would be a event based update, saving a lot of unnecessary calls to the server. while still maintaining the accuracy and right customer experience.

__Data Optimzation__ we are storing only the compisite key and status of the order in redis, so it would be a very small amount of data (approx 50 bytes per order), and thats what we need more often, so it would be a very efficient use of memory. More details about the order can be fetched from the main database when needed.


__High Availability and Reliability of System__ if the redis ever goes down or misses a request we will fallback to main database. Eventually providing good customer experience during a redis outage instead of failing all the requests.

### 3. Enterprise Scaling Architecture
__Design Decision:__ Microservices with Event-Driven Communication



| Architecture | 10K orders/hr | 50K orders/hr | 100K orders/hr | Infrastructure Cost |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | Supported | Failed | Failed | $200/month |
| **Microservices** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **$450/month** |
| Serverless | Supported | Supported | Cold Start Issues | $650/month |
| Message Queue Only | Supported | Supported | Supported | $800/month |



__Service Isolation Strategy:__

### **Order Processing Service** (CPU-Intensive)
- **Responsibility**: Data transformation, validation, business logic
- **Scaling**: Horizontal (3-10 instances based on CPU usage)
- **Resource Profile**: High CPU, Medium Memory

### **Notification Service** (Connection-Intensive)  
- **Responsibility**: WebSocket management, real-time updates
- **Scaling**: Vertical (larger instances with more memory)
- **Resource Profile**: Low CPU, High Memory (connection state)

__Inter-Service Communication Analysis:__

| Communication Method | Latency | Infrastructure Cost | Operational Complexity | Failure Handling |
|---------------------|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Direct HTTP | 1-3ms | $0 | Low | Simple retry |
| **Message Broker** | **0.1-0.5ms** | **$200-400/month** | **High** | **Complex dead letter queues** |

**Decision**: **HTTP for cost efficiency at acceptable latency trade-off**

**Rationale**: 
- 2ms latency difference acceptable for our use case
- Saves $200-400/month in infrastructure costs
- Simpler operational overhead and debugging
- Easier failure recovery with basic retry logic


### 4. Advanced Resilience Patterns
__Problem Statement:__ Service failures should not cascade or result in data loss

**Hybrid Resilience Approach**: Instead of rejecting requests during outages, we provide graceful degradation with customer choice.

**Implementation**: [`question1-code/resilience_patterns.js`](./question1-code/resilience_patterns.js)

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Phase 1 (0-30 seconds)**: Attempt partner assignment with timeout
- **Phase 2 (Assignment Delayed)**: Queue order, offer customer choice to wait or cancel
- **Phase 3 (Extended Attempt)**: If customer waits, try partner assignment for 60 more seconds
- **Phase 4 (Final Choice)**: If still fails, offer background processing or cancel
- **Phase 5 (Background)**: Process in background with notifications when partner assigned

**Customer Experience During Partner Assignment Delays:**
- **30-second timer**: "Finding delivery partner..."
- **Assignment delayed**: "Partner assignment taking longer than usual"
- **Customer choice 1**: "Wait 1 more minute - we'll keep trying to assign partner" OR "Cancel order"
- **If extended attempt fails**: "Process order in background - we'll notify when partner assigned" OR "Cancel order"
- **Background processing**: Continuous partner assignment attempts with proactive notifications

**Traditional vs Enhanced Approach:**
- **Traditional**: Simply reject requests during outages
- **Enhanced**: Provide customer value even during failures with graceful degradation



## Risk Analysis & Mitigation
__Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies__

### 1. Database Failure (High Impact, Low Probability)
- **Risk**: Complete order processing halt
- **Mitigation**: Read replicas + automated failover + 30-second RTO
- **Fallback**: Queue orders in Redis for 5-minute database recovery window

### 2. Redis Cache Failure (Medium Impact, Low Probability)
- **Risk**: Duplicate orders during cache rebuild
- **Mitigation**: Database constraint as secondary check + immediate cache warming
- **Impact**: 10% performance degradation for 2-3 minutes

### 3. Partner Service Extended Outage (Low Impact, Medium Probability)
- **Risk**: All orders assigned to default partners
- **Mitigation**: Smart circuit breaker + background optimization + manual reassignment tools
- **Business Continuity**: 100% order processing continues

### 4. API Rate Limiting from E-commerce Platforms
- **Risk**: Webhook delivery failures
- **Mitigation**: Exponential backoff retry + platform-specific rate limiting + status page integration
